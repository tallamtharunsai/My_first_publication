In this I have taken very small dataset of just 300 observations and 14 attributes. In this I have observed how the algorithms perform on such type of datasets. And the visualizations of the boundaries of how the algorithms classify their boundaries on this type of non linearly serperable datasets.

The for dimentionality Reduction I have applied PCA algorithm. By this my accuray have improved. Thus I have concluded that even for small datasets the PCA algorithm can be used to reduce the dimentions.

Dataset is taken from UCI The link is :

I have used the processed data set which is in the parent directory.
